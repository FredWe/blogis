# Blogiss
![blogiss-logo](blogiss-logo.png)

Another view to automatically transform Github issues as blogs.
Why a view of issues blogs is important? Cause **Everyone** could post on a blogger's own zone. That's annoying :P

## Tutorial
- **Blogiss-minimized**: 
  1. To make it works, simply fork / [download](https://github.com/FredWe/blogiss/archive/master.zip) / copy & paste the only 2 core files, [`index.html`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredWe/blogiss/master/index.html) & [`config.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredWe/blogiss/master/config.json) to your own location.
  2. Modify `config.json` to anything you want.
  3. Then you have a Github issues blog. Nothing more than that :P
