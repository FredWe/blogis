![blogiss-logo](blogiss-logo.png)

Another view to automatically transform Github issues as blogs.
Why a view of issues blogs is important? Cause **Everyone** could post on a blogger's own zone. That's annoying :P

Target: https://github.com/FredWe/blogiss/issues

Example:
- [My own blog](http://fredwe.info)
- [A view of @lifesinger 's blog](http://fredwe.info/blogiss/example)
